# This program produces a map of volcanoes in the US as an html file (which you can open in your browser) 

Example of the map is attached. In the top right corner you can toggle on and off volcanoes and population parameters.

For volcanoes, filling of the circle is determined by the height of the volcano:
less than 1000 metres = green

1000 - 3000 metres = orange

3000 metres or more = red

The colour of the country is determined by it's population as of 2005:

less than 10 million people = green
10 - 20 million = orange
more than 20 million = red

* Note: it is possible to create a more accurate coloring based on distribution of the population or height of the volcanoes

Map1 and Map2 produce identical output, but are results of map.py and map_using_df.py, respectively.

While both programs use pandas, syntax in map_using_df.py explicitely uses data frames
