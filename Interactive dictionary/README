# This is an interactive dictionary that runs in command prompt. 

How does it work:
1) Enter a word. If the word is in the dictionary, return the definition.
2) If the word is not in the dictionary (e.g. spelling mistake), look for similar word. 
    a) If similar word is found, show it to the user and ask if that's the word user is looking for. If that's the case, show the definitons.
    b) If not similar word is found, print "The word doesn't exist. Please double check it."
3) The program also accepts words spelled in lower case by mistake e.g. paris instead of Paris.
